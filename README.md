# Amusment Park Pass Generator iPad app

This iPad application generates passes for everyone entering the amusement park. Pass generator is to be operated by a counter desk; therefore, the app follows specific business logic, where each entrant has different permissions ranging from discounts, access permissions and the ability to skip lines. Mostly there are three different types of entrants including, guests, employees and vendors which each have their subtypes. The user of the application chooses the entrant type, enters the necessary details and generates the pass, where on the second view the permissions can be tested.
